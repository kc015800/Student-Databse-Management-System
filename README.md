# Student Databse Management System


## Brief 
This project has proceeded with the aim of developing a system to maintain student data. this project has an intention solving the problem faced by some schools and colleges which are still maintaining student data in large amount of ledgers and books where, searching student data with specific names, and year and categorising student learning is very difficult, so here im introducing a local database system which has an interface inorder to interact with it in a most easy way. they just have to install it in there system inorder to work with it. since the data is stored in local database there is no need to have internet connectivity. in this project i have used Python 3 as a programming language and Mysql as a database.
